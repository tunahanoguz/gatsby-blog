Too many "beginner React" material starts with JSX and a bunch of tools. React itself is remarkably simple (and the docs are amazingly good). Sadly, everything around it can get complicated quickly and it can be hard to know where the lines are between React and the tools and libraries you use it with.

And then beyond the basics, it's hard to find a consistent, complete, all in one framework that you can use to confidently build and ship React applications.

Instead we are left piecing together components like a jigsaw puzzle.

The React docs themselves give us a clear idea about how to structure React components and the pieces that we need to fit together, but they leave it up to us almost completely when it comes to assembling those components into the bigger picture of an application.
